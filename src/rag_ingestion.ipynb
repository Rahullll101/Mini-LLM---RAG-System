Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3].

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems. [11]–[14][S6]. However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

They have deeper architectures with the\\ncapacity to learn more complex features than the shallow ones.\\nAlso the expressivity and robust training algorithms allow to\\nlearn informative object representations without the need to\\ndesign features manually [26].\\nSince the proposal of R-CNN, a great deal of improved\\nmodels have been suggested, including Fast R-CNN which\\njointly optimizes classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ntasks [16], Faster R-CNN which takes an additional sub-\\nnetwork to generate region proposals [18] and YOLO which\\naccomplishes object detection via a ﬁxed-grid regression [17].\\nAll of them bring different degrees of detection performance\\nimprovements over the primary R-CNN and make real-time\\nand accurate object detection become more achievable.\\nIn this paper, a systematic review is provided to summarise\\nrepresentative models and their different characteristics in\\nseveral application domains, including generic object detec-\\ntion [15], [16], [18], salient object detection [27], [28], face\\ndetection [29]–[31] and pedestrian detection [32], [33].

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n• The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n• Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n• Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [26].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,'),\n",

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n• Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. GENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression/classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization.

The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n• Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n• Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n• Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net: FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4. Different from R-CNN, SPP-net reuses\\nfeature maps of the 5-th conv layer (conv5) to project region'),\n",

The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64]. The layer after the ﬁnal conv layer is referred\\nto as spatial pyramid pooling layer (SPP layer). If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 × (12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C + 1 categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p, u, tu, v) = Lcls(p, u) + λ[u ≥1]Lloc(tu, v)\\n(1)\\nwhere Lcls(p, u) = −log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p = (p0, · · · , pC) over the C +1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu, v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx, tu\\ny, tu\\nw, tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx, vy, vw, vh), where x, y, w, h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u ≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu, v) =\\nX\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1(tu\\ni −vi)\\n(2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1(x) =\\n(\\n0.5x2\\nif |x| < 1\\n|x| −0.5\\notherwise\\n(3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss. It saves the additional\\nexpense on storage space, and improves both accuracy and\\nefﬁciency with more reasonable training schemes.\\n4) Faster R-CNN: Despite the attempt to generate candi-\\ndate boxes with biased sampling [88], state-of-the-art object\\ndetection networks mainly rely on additional methods, such as\\nselective search and Edgebox, to generate a candidate pool of\\nisolated region proposals. Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals. RPN operates on a speciﬁc conv layer with the preceding\\nlayers shared with object detection network.'),\n",

This decomposition originates from pioneering\\nclassiﬁcation architectures (e.g. AlexNet [6] and VGG16 [46])\\nwhich consist of a convolutional subnetwork and several FC\\nlayers separated by a speciﬁc spatial pooling layer.\\nRecent state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation networks, such\\nas Residual Nets (ResNets) [47] and GoogLeNets [45], [93],\\nare fully convolutional.

However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k × k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)).

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 × 1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a 3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m × m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling:\\nAlthough the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100].

To obtain contextual and multi-\\nscale representations, Bell et al. proposed the Inside-Outside\\nNet (ION) by exploiting information both inside and outside\\nthe RoI [95] with spatial recurrent neural networks [111] and\\nskip pooling [101]. Zagoruyko et al. proposed the MultiPath\\narchitecture by introducing three modiﬁcations to the Fast\\nR-CNN [112], including multi-scale skip connections [95],\\na modiﬁed foveal structure [110] and a novel loss function\\nsumming different IoU losses.\\n9) Thinking in Deep Learning based Object Detection:\\nApart from the above approaches, there are still many impor-\\ntant factors for continued progress.\\nThere is a large imbalance between the number of annotated\\nobjects and background examples. To address this problem,\\nShrivastava et al. proposed an effective online mining algo-\\nrithm (OHEM) [113] for automatic selection of the hard ex-\\namples, which leads to a more effective and efﬁcient training.\\nInstead of concentrating on feature extraction, Ren et al.\\nmade a detailed analysis on object classiﬁers [114], and\\nfound that it is of particular importance for object detection\\nto construct a deep and convolutional per-region classiﬁer\\ncarefully, especially for ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45].\\nTraditional CNN framework for object detection is not\\nskilled in handling signiﬁcant scale variation, occlusion or\\ntruncation, especially when only 2D object detection is in-\\nvolved. To address this problem, Xiang et al. proposed a\\nnovel subcategory-aware region proposal network [60], which\\nguides the generation of region proposals with subcategory\\ninformation related to object poses and jointly optimize object\\ndetection and subcategory classiﬁcation.\\nOuyang et al. found that the samples from different classes\\nfollow a longtailed distribution [115], which indicates that dif-\\nferent classes with distinct numbers of samples have different\\ndegrees of impacts on feature learning. To this end, objects are\\nﬁrstly clustered into visually similar class groups, and then a\\nhierarchical feature learning scheme is adopted to learn deep\\nrepresentations for each group separately.\\nIn order to minimize computational cost and achieve the\\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the ‘deep and thin’ design\\nprinciple and following the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, Hong et\\nal. proposed the architecture of PVANET [116], which adopts\\nsome building blocks including concatenated ReLU [117],\\nInception [45], and HyperNet [101] to reduce the expense on\\nmulti-scale feature extraction and trains the network with batch\\nnormalization [43], residual connections [47], and learning\\nrate scheduling based on plateau detection [47]. The PVANET\\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance and can be processed\\nin real time on Titan X GPU (21 FPS).\\nB. Regression/Classiﬁcation Based Framework\\nRegion proposal based frameworks are composed of sev-\\neral correlated stages, including region proposal generation,\\nfeature extraction with CNN, classiﬁcation and bounding box\\nregression, which are usually trained separately. Even in recent\\nend-to-end module Faster R-CNN, an alternative training is\\nstill required to obtain shared convolution parameters between\\nRPN and detection network. As a result, the time spent in\\nhandling different components becomes the bottleneck in real-\\ntime application.\\nOne-step\\nframeworks\\nbased\\non\\nglobal\\nregres-\\nsion/classiﬁcation, mapping straightly from image pixels\\nto bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, can\\nreduce time expense. We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119]. Inference is efﬁcient since class scores and\\nsegmentation can be obtained in a single model with most of\\nthe CNN operations shared.\\nErhan et al. proposed regression based MultiBox to produce\\nscored class-agnostic region proposals [68], [120]. A uniﬁed\\nloss was introduced to bias both localization and conﬁdences\\nof multiple components to predict the coordinates of class-\\nagnostic bounding boxes. However, a large quantity of addi-\\ntional parameters are introduced to the ﬁnal layer.\\nYoo et al. adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach to\\nhandle object detection and proposed an impressive end-to-\\nend CNN architecture named AttentionNet [69]. Starting from\\nthe top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner of an image,\\nAttentionNet points to a target object by generating quantized\\nweak directions and converges to an accurate object bound-\\nary box with an ensemble of iterative predictions. However,\\nthe model becomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple\\ncategories with a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi et al. proposed a proposal-free iterative grid based\\nobject detector (G-CNN), which models object detection as'),\n",

Starting with a ﬁxed multi-scale bounding box\\ngrid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and scale elements of\\nthe grid towards objects iteratively. However, G-CNN has a\\ndifﬁculty in dealing with small or highly overlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S × S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOU truth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects (Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction (IOU truth\\npred ). At the same\\ntime, regardless of the number of boxes, C conditional class\\nprobabilities (Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in\\neach grid cell. It should be noticed that only the contribution\\nfrom the grid cell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows.\\nPr(Object) ∗IOU truth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOU truth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized,\\nλcoord\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\\x02\\n(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2\\x03\\n+λcoord\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\"\\x12√wi −\\np\\nˆwi)2 + (\\np\\nhi −\\nq\\nˆhi\\n\\x132#\\n+\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1obj\\nij\\n\\x10\\nCi −ˆCi\\n\\x112\\n+λnoobj\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\nB\\nX\\nj=0\\n1noobj\\nij\\n\\x10\\nCi −ˆCi\\n\\x112\\n+\\nS2\\nX\\ni=0\\n1obj\\ni\\nX\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi, yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell, (wi, hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents conﬁdence\\nscores, 1obj\\ni\\nindicates the existence of objects and 1obj\\nij\\ndenotes\\nthat the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding box\\npredictor. Note that only when an object is present in that grid\\ncell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors. Similarly,\\nwhen the predictor is ‘responsible’ for the ground truth box\\n(i.e. the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell is\\nachieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real-time at 45\\nFPS and a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 FPS\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales and\\naspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences. The network is\\ntrained with a weighted sum of localization loss (e.g. Smooth\\nL1) and conﬁdence loss (e.g. Softmax), which is similar to\\n(1). Final detection results are obtained by conducting NMS\\non multi-scale reﬁned bounding boxes.\\nIntegrating with hard negative mining, data augmentation\\nand a larger number of carefully chosen default anchors,\\nSSD signiﬁcantly outperforms the Faster R-CNN in terms of\\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO, while being three\\ntimes faster. The SSD300 (input image size is 300×300) runs\\nat 59 FPS, which is more accurate and efﬁcient than YOLO.\\nHowever, SSD is not skilled at dealing with small objects,\\nwhich can be relieved by adopting better feature extractor\\nbackbone (e.g. ResNet101), adding deconvolution layers with\\nskip connections to introduce additional large-scale context\\n[73] and designing better network structure (e.g. Stem Block\\nand Dense Block) [74].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nWe compare various object detection methods on three\\nbenchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2007 [25],\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 [121] and Microsoft COCO [94]. The\\nevaluated approaches include R-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast\\nR-CNN [16], NOC [114], Bayes [85], MR-CNN&S-CNN\\n[105], Faster R-CNN [18], HyperNet [101], ION [95], MS-\\nGR [104], StuffNet [100], SSD300 [71], SSD512 [71], OHEM\\n[113], SDP+CRC [33], GCNN [70], SubCNN [60], GBD-Net\\n[109], PVANET [116], YOLO [17], YOLOv2 [72], R-FCN\\n[65], FPN [66], Mask R-CNN [67], DSSD [73] and DSOD\\n[74]. If no speciﬁc instructions for the adopted framework\\nare provided, the utilized model is a VGG16 [46] pretrained\\non 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [39]. Due to the\\nlimitation of paper length, we only provide an overview, in-\\ncluding proposal, learning method, loss function, programming\\nlanguage and platform, of the prominent architectures in Table\\nI. Detailed experimental settings, which can be found in the\\noriginal papers, are missed. In addition to the comparisons of\\ndetection accuracy, another comparison is provided to evaluate\\ntheir test consumption on PASCAL VOC 2007.\\n1) PASCAL VOC 2007/2012: PASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012 datasets consist of 20 categories. The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n• If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n• Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n• Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n• As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n• By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n•\\nOverall,\\nregion\\nproposal\\nbased\\nmethods,\\nsuch\\nas\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n• Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n• The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 + β2)Presion × Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall\\n(7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE =\\n1\\nH × W\\nH\\nX\\ni=1\\nW\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ˆS(i, j) = ˆZ(i, j)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n(8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. FACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

Li et al.\\n[175] proposed a multi-task discriminative learning framework\\nwhich integrates a ConvNet with a ﬁxed 3D mean face model\\nin an end-to-end manner.

This network takes a multi-task RPN to predict\\ncandidate face regions along with associated facial landmarks\\nsimultaneously, and adopts a generic R-CNN to verify the\\nexistence of valid faces. Yang et al. proposed a three-stage\\ncascade structure based on FCNs [8], while in each stage, a\\nmulti-scale FCN is utilized to reﬁne the positions of possible\\nfaces. Qin et al. proposed a uniﬁed framework which achieves\\nbetter results with the complementary information from dif-\\nferent jointly trained CNNs [178].\\nB. Experimental Evaluation\\nThe FDDB [179] dataset has a total of 2,845 pictures in\\nwhich 5,171 faces are annotated with elliptical shape. Two\\ntypes of evaluations are used: the discrete score and continuous\\nscore.

Unitbox\\nprovides an alternative choice for performance improvements\\nby carefully designing optimization loss.\\nFrom these results, we can draw the conclusion that\\nCNN based methods are in the leading position. The perfor-\\nmance can be improved by the following strategies: designing\\nnovel optimization loss, modifying generic detection pipelines,\\nbuilding meaningful network cascades, adapting scale-aware\\ndetection and learning multi-task shared CNN features.\\nVI. PEDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET.

Du et al. proposed\\na deep neural network fusion architecture for fast and robust\\npedestrian detection [207]. Based on the candidate bounding\\nboxes generated with SSD detectors [71], multiple binary\\nclassiﬁers are processed parallelly to conduct soft-rejection\\nbased network fusion (SNF) by consulting their aggregated\\ndegree of conﬁdences.\\nHowever, most of these approaches are much more sophisti-\\ncated than the standard R-CNN framework. CompACT-Deep\\nconsists of a variety of hand-crafted features, a small CNN\\nmodel and a large VGG16 model [195]. DeepParts contains\\n45 ﬁne-tuned DCNN models, and a set of strategies, including\\nbounding box shifting handling and part selection, are required\\nto arrive at the reported results [204]. So the modiﬁcation and\\nsimpliﬁcation is of signiﬁcance to reduce the burden on both\\nsoftware and hardware to satisfy real-time detection demand.\\nTome et al. proposed a novel solution to adapt generic object\\ndetection pipeline to pedestrian detection by optimizing most\\nof its stages [59]. Hu et al. [208] trained an ensemble of\\nboosted decision models by reusing the conv feature maps, and\\na further improvement was gained with simple pixel labelling\\nand additional complementary hand-crafted features. Tome\\net al. [209] proposed a reduced memory region based deep\\nCNN architecture, which fuses regional responses from both\\nACF detectors and SVM classiﬁers into R-CNN.

Experimental Evaluation\\nThe evaluation is conducted on the most popular Caltech\\nPedestrian dataset [3].

(unclear identiﬁcations)’ and ‘People (large group of\\nindividuals)’, are assigned to different BBs. The performance\\nis measured with the log-average miss rate (L-AMR) which\\nis computed evenly spaced in log-space in the range 10−2 to\\n1 by averaging miss rate at the rate of nine false positives\\nper image (FPPI) [3]. According to the differences in the\\nheight and visible part of the BBs, a total of 9 popular settings\\nare adopted to evaluate different properties of these models.\\nDetails of these settings are as [3].\\nEvaluated methods include Checkerboards+ [198], LDCF++\\n[S2], SCF+AlexNet [210], SA-FastRCNN [211], MS-CNN'),\n",

The ﬁrst two methods are based\\non hand-crafted features while the rest ones rely on deep CNN\\nfeatures. All results are exhibited in Table VII. From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. PROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n• Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n• Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n• Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n• 3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.

The larger heavier particles settle out ofthe air quickly and are hazardous to\\ntho operators ofplant and equipment (on-site) and to those in the immediate vicinity (off-site).\\nThe frner small particles (usually invisible) are transported further causing health hazards (off-\\nsite).\\nmeasures:\\nSuggestive measures/practices for employer to strengthen the workforcel\\ni) Sensitization of workers (skilled or unskilled labour) on health, safety and environmental\\nprotection.\\nii) Training of all workers on the potential health risks associated with air pollution, air quality\\nindex (AQI), expected hazards of air pollution due to prolonged exposure.\\niii) Training of workers operating a motor vehicle on the job (on or off premises) on vehicle\\nmaintenance to ensure operation of vehicle within emission norms and minimize air\\npollution.\\niv) Awareness program for workers on implementation of emergency preparedness plan based\\non Disaster Management Plan. This will ensure workers are prepared to respond to\\nemergencies effectively.\\nv) Training on the correct selection, use, and maintenance of Personal Protective Equipmant\\n(PPE) is essential. Workers should be equipped with appropriate PPE, such as face masks\\nand respirators, to protect themselves from airborne pollutants and other site-specific\\nhazards.\\nlSafety Manual for Construction Workers, Labour Depanment, Directorate oflndustrial Safety and Health\\n23 lPage\\nHealth Advisory on Air Pollution under NPCCHH\\n24\\nI\\nFlle No. F,No.7oINCOC/CEOH&CCH/2o18-19/AP_Advisory \\n(Computer No, 3t75972)\\nG.n.r.t€d ftom eotrice by BR!

INTRODUCTION \\n \\nMachine learning is increasingly important because it can handle complex tasks that \\nare too much for humans, especially when dealing with big data that we can't process \\nmanually. This technology trains computers to make our lives easier by learning from large \\namounts of data and making predictions. It saves us time and money. \\n \\nMachine learning is a part of AI that lets machines learn from data and get better over \\ntime. It works by training on lots of data to do tasks like predicting trends or spotting \\npatterns. \\n \\nAI is everywhere now, in self-driving cars, detecting frauds, recognizing faces, and \\neven suggesting friends on social media. It helps companies like Netflix and Amazon \\nrecommend things to customers by learning what they like. \\n \\nIII. TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING \\n \\nThe four main types of machine learning are: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Supervised Learning \\n\\uf0b7 Unsupervised Learning \\n\\uf0b7 Semi-Supervised Learning \\n\\uf0b7 Reinforcement Learning \\n \\nA. Supervised Learning \\n \\nSupervised learning is a method where the computer is given a dataset that's already \\norganized with correct answers. It studies this data to understand patterns, like a student\"),\n",

The computer is shown data (like pictures or numbers) and the \\nanswers (like 'cat' or 'price'). It then learns to connect the two. After it's trained, you can give \\nit new data it hasn't seen before, and it will use what it's learned to make good guesses. \\n \\nFor instance, as shown in Fig 1, if you show it pictures with labels, like 'spoon' or \\n'knife', the computer looks at the details shape, size, sharpness—and learns to tell them apart. \\nLater, if you show it a new picture without a label, it uses what it learned to guess if it's a \\nspoon or a knife. It’s like pairing things up: you show it what an input (like a picture) should \\nlead to, which is the output (like the word 'Spoon' or ‘Knife’). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1:  Supervised Learning \\n \\nIn this algorithm the computer recognizes and understand the pattern between the \\ninput variable-x (what you show it) and the output variable -y (what it’s supposed to say). In \\nthe real world, this helps with things like figuring out if a bank transaction is suspicious or if \\nan email is junk. \\n  \\nWorking of Supervised Learning  \\n \\nIn supervised learning, models undergo training with a labelled dataset, allowing them \\nto recognize and learn from various data types. After training, the model's knowledge is \\nevaluated using test data a portion of the dataset originally set aside for this purpose—to \\nascertain its predictive capabilities. The mechanics of supervised learning are clarified further \\nthrough specific examples and illustrative diagrams shown in Fig. 2 \\n \\nSuppose there is a dataset comprising various shapes such as squares, rectangles, \\ntriangles, and polygons as shown in Fig.2. The initial step involves training a model to \\nrecognize each type of shape with the following criteria: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Square - A shape with four equal sides is labelled. \\n\\uf0b7 Triangle - A shape with three sides is classified or labelled. \\n\\uf0b7 Hexagon - A shape with six equal sides is recognized or labelled .\"),\n",

Semi-Supervised Learning \\n \\nSemi-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that incorporates elements \\nfrom both supervised learning (which uses labelled data) and unsupervised learning (which \\nuses unlabelled data). It is particularly useful when acquiring labelled data is expensive or \\nlabour-intensive but there's an abundance of unlabelled data available. In practice, semi-\\nsupervised learning algorithms work with a small amount of labelled data supplemented by a \\nlarger amount of unlabelled data. The goal is to leverage the structure and distribution of the \\nunlabelled data to better understand the overall dataset and make more accurate predictions. \\n \\nIn a real-world analogy, think of semi-supervised learning as a student who has \\nreceived some instruction from a teacher (supervised learning) but is also expected to study \\nand learn on their own (unsupervised learning). The combination of these learning methods \\nhelps the student to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. \\nSimilarly, semi-supervised learning aims to create a model that learns from both the guidance \\nprovided by the labelled data and the freedom to explore and make inferences from the \\nunlabelled data. \\n \\nAdvantages of Semi-Supervised Learning \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Simplicity: The algorithms are generally straightforward and user-friendly, making \\nthem easy to grasp. \\n\\uf0b7 Efficiency: These algorithms can be highly efficient, as they require fewer labelled \\ninstances. \\n\\uf0b7 Problem-Solving: They address certain limitations of both supervised and \\nunsupervised learning by utilizing a mix of labelled and unlabelled data. \\n \\nDisadvantages of Semi-Supervised Learning \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Stability: The results across iterations can be inconsistent, leading to potential \\ninstability in the model's performance. \\n\\uf0b7 Data Limitations: These algorithms are not well-suited for network-level data which \\nrequires different analytical approaches. \\n\\uf0b7 Lower Accuracy: The accuracy of semi-supervised learning may not match that of \\nfully supervised learning, especially if the labelled data is not representative of the \\nentire dataset.\"),\n",

Reinforcement Learning: Learning Through Interaction \\n \\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an AI agent \\nlearns to make decisions by executing actions and receiving feedback, optimizing for a \\ncumulative reward. This method stands out because it does not need labelled data. Instead, \\nthe agent learns through the outcomes of its actions, akin to trial and error. \\n \\nThe RL process parallels human experiential learning, much like how a child learns \\nfrom daily interactions. For instance, in video games, the agent learns to play better by \\nmaking moves (actions) in various situations (states) and receiving scores (rewards or \\npenalties) for those moves. \\n \\nReinforcement learning has diverse applications across fields such as game theory, \\noperations research, and multi-agent systems. Typically, RL problems are framed as Markov \\nDecision Processes, where the agent's interaction with its environment involves a cycle of \\nstates, actions, and feedback, leading to new states and learning opportunities. \\n \\nTypes of Reinforcement Learning \\n \\na. Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: The agent builds a model of the \\nenvironment to understand state transitions and rewards. Using this model, the agent \\nplans out actions to maximize rewards. Algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy \\nIteration fall into this category. \\nb. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning: Here, the agent learns a policy directly from \\ninteractions with the environment without modelling it. It updates its policy based on \\nthe reward outcomes of its actions. Q-Learning, SARSA, and Deep Reinforcement \\nLearning are key model-free algorithms. \\n \\nCategories of Reinforcement Learning \\n \\nReinforcement learning can be divided primarily into two types based on the nature of \\nthe reinforcement provided: \\n \\na. Positive Reinforcement Learning: This type involves increasing the likelihood that \\na desired behavior will be repeated in the future by introducing a positive reward or \\nincentive. It strengthens the behavior of the agent and has a beneficial effect on its \\nactions. \\nb. Negative Reinforcement Learning: This category operates on the principle of \\nincreasing the probability that a particular behavior will occur again by removing or \\navoiding a negative condition. It's based on the concept that actions that lead to the \\nremoval of an adverse event will be reinforced and hence more likely to recur. \\n \\nReal-World Use Cases of Reinforcement Learning \\n \\na. Video Games: Reinforcement learning (RL) is extensively used in video games to \\nachieve performances beyond human capabilities. Notable examples include\"),\n",

The \\nplatform has access to vast amounts of user interaction data but lacks explicit labels for \\ncommunity membership. \\n \\nChallenge: Identifying communities within a social network is complex due to the vastness \\nof data and the dynamic nature of social interactions. The platform needs a method to discern \\nthese communities based on patterns of interactions without predefined labels. \\n \\nApproach: The company employs unsupervised learning, specifically clustering algorithms \\nthat can detect communities based on user interactions such as likes, comments, shares, and \\nmessaging patterns. Algorithms considered for this task include K-Means, Hierarchical \\nClustering, and DBSCAN. \\n \\nImplementation: The team compiles a dataset consisting of anonymized user interaction \\ndata. Features such as frequency of interactions, strength of connections (e.g., number of \\nmutual friends), and similarity in content engagement are extracted. The clustering \\nalgorithms are applied to this data to identify distinct user communities. \\n \\nOutcome: The unsupervised learning approach effectively reveals distinct communities \\nwithin the social network. These communities show high internal interaction rates and are \\ncharacterized by shared interests or demographics. The insights gained are used to improve \\nthe user experience by personalizing content and optimizing ad targeting. \\n \\nQuestions for Discussion \\n \\n1. What methods were used to ensure user privacy while conducting the analysis? \\n2. How did the platform determine the number of communities, and what validation \\nmethods were used to assess the quality of the clustering? \\n3. Which clustering algorithm was most effective in identifying meaningful communities, \\nand what were its key parameters?'),\n",

For people with mental\\nhealth problems, achieving this right is particularly challenging.  The\\nInternational Labour Organisation’s (ILO) mandate on disability issues is\\nlaid down in the ILO Convention concerning Vocational Rehabilitation and\\nEmployment of Disabled Persons No. 159 (1983), which establishes the\\nprinciple of equal treatment and employment for workers with disabilities.\\nThe convention defines a disabled person as an individual whose prospects\\nof securing, retaining, and advancing in suitable employment are substan-\\ntially reduced as a result of a duly recognized physical or mental impair-\\nment. \\nFor decades the ILO has been advocating equal employment opportunities\\nand setting up effective preventive and vocational rehabilitation pro-\\ngrammes for people with disabilities. More recently, the importance of\\nspecifically addressing the employment of people with mental health diffi-\\nculties has been acknowledged.  Employees’ mental health problems and\\ntheir impact on enterprise productivity and medical costs are critical\\nhuman resource issues.  Increasingly, trade unions and employers’ organi-\\nsations and government policy makers are realising that the social and eco-\\nnomic costs of mental health problems in the workplace cannot be ignored.\\nThe ILO’s Target Groups Unit, in the Infocus1 Programme on Skills,\\nKnowledge, and Employability, focuses on the human resource needs of\\nvulnerable groups, including individuals with mental health difficulties,\\nand promotes the inclusion of persons with mental health difficulties and\\nphysical disabilities into mainstream training and employment.  The ILO’s\\noccupational safety and health programmes, Safe Work and Conditions of\\nWork, complement these activities by dealing with issues of occupational\\nsafety and health and working conditions.\\nThis summary and the situation analyses resulting from the project\\n“Mental health in the workplace” highlight the importance of decent work\\nin enhancing the economic and social integration of people with mental\\nhealth difficulties.  They analyse the scope and impact of mental health\\nproblems in the labour markets in five countries, Finland, Germany,\\nPoland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and describe what has\\nbeen done so far to advance and advocate for employment for people with\\nmental health difficulties. \\nIntroduction \\nMENTAL HEALTH AND DISABILITY\\nM\\nental health difficulties can affect an individual’s functional and\\nworking capacity in numerous ways.  Depending on an individual’s\\nage at the onset of a mental health problem, his or her working capacity\\ncan be significantly reduced.  In the workplace, this can lead to absen-\\nteeism, require sick leave, and reduce productivity.  Long-term mental\\nhealth difficulties are, according to a WHO report, one of the three leading\\ncauses of disability, along with cardiovascular disease and musculo-skele-\\n1\\nThe International\\nLabour\\nOrganisation’s\\nmandate on dis-\\nability issues is\\nlaid down in the\\nILO Convention\\nconcerning\\nVocational\\nRehabilitation and\\nEmployment of\\nDisabled Persons\\nNo. 159 (1983),\\nwhich establishes\\nthe principle of\\nequal treatment\\nand employment\\nfor workers with\\ndisabilities.'),\n",

The United Nations estimates that 25% of the entire pop-\\nulation is adversely affected in one way or another as a result of disabilities.2\\nMental health problems do not just affect the individual.  They impact the\\nentire community. The cost of excluding people with mental health difficul-\\nties from an active role in community life is high.  Exclusion often leads to\\ndiminished productivity and losses in human potential.  The cost of mental\\nhealth problems, and of other disabilities, has three components:3\\n•\\nthe direct cost of welfare services and treatment, including the costs\\nof disability benefits, travel, access to services, medication etc;\\n•\\nthe indirect cost to those who are not directly affected such as care-\\ngivers ;\\n•\\nthe opportunity costs of income foregone due to incapacity.\\nPeople with mental health difficulties face environmental, institutional and\\nattitudinal barriers in finding mainstream employment or returning to work\\nand retaining jobs after treatment.  Attitudinal barriers and social exclusion\\nare often the hardest obstacles to overcome and usually are associated with\\nfeelings of shame, fear, and rejection.4\\nStigma surrounds people with mental health difficulties, and the recovery\\nprocess is often misunderstood.  Stigmatisation can negatively affect the\\nsuccess of vocational efforts.  For example, it has been reported that many\\nprofessional workers who either resign a job or take a medical leave related\\nto a mental illness episode, such as depression, experience difficulty main-\\ntaining a stigma-free relationship with their employers.  Those returning to\\nthe same work environment find that performance and behavioural difficul-\\nties, which initially interrupted their work, have altered their employers’\\nand co-workers’ perception of their professional abilities.5\\nIt is clear that mental health problems can impose a heavy burden in terms\\nof social exclusion, stigmatisation, and economic costs for people with men-\\ntal health difficulties and their families.  Unfortunately, the future burden\\nis likely to grow over time as a result of the ageing of the population and\\nstresses resulting from social problems and unrest, including violence, con-\\nflict, and natural disasters.6 In many countries, however, policy makers and\\nservice providers have recognised the need to take steps to prevent problems\\nfrom arising and to respond more effectively to the growing need for mental\\nhealth care services. \\nUSING THE WORKPLACE TO PREVENT, IDENTIFY, AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS\\nFOR REFERRAL AND REHABILITATION\\nT\\nhe workplace is an appropriate environment in which to educate indi-\\nviduals and raise their awareness about mental health difficulties and\\ntarget mental health problems and prevent them from developing.\\nPromotion of good mental health practices can be part of human resource\\nmanagement policy, and occupational health care services can play an\\nimportant role in early recognition and identification of mental health diffi-\\nculties in the workplace.  This does not, however, ignore the multidimen-\\nsional nature of effective mental health services or the mutiplicity of factors\\ncontributing to an individual’s mental health.\\nThe development of mental health problems is complicated, and often there\\nis no single or identifiable cause.  Nonetheless, there are risk factors that\\nmay trigger mental health problems in certain people, including heredity,\\nnegative life events, certain medications, diseases or illnesses, and work-\\nrelated stress.

To guarantee the best results in international competition, it is in the\\ninterest of employers to provide their employees with decent working con-\\nditions.10\\nTHE PURPOSE OF THE SITUATION ANALYSES\\nT\\nhe purpose of the situation analyses is to provide an in-depth review of\\nthe scope and impact of mental health difficulties in the workplace in\\nFinland, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the USA.11\\nThe countries were\\nselected because they represent different types of welfare systems and vary\\nin terms of legislation, health care, and approaches to mental health issues.\\nThe UK and the USA emphasise the individual’s rights, and their approach\\nstems from strong anti-discrimination legislation.  Finland and Germany\\nprovide examples of countries with a long history of mainstreaming, where-\\nas Poland is just developing its approach to mental health issues.  Germany\\nand the UK have also been active in the effort, spearheaded by Finland, to\\naddress mental health issues in the European Union. \\nThese situation analyses address issues such as workplace productivity,\\nloss of income, health-care and social security costs, and access to mental\\nhealth services and provide examples of employer practices.  An essential\\nobjective of the situation analyses is to provide information that govern-\\nmental agencies, unions, and employers’ organisations can use to create\\neducational materials and design programmes to promote mental health,\\nprevent problems from occurring, and develop rehabilitation services. \\nMETHODOLOGY\\nT\\nhe analyses are based on a thorough literature review, including docu-\\nments from government agencies, employees’ and employers’ organisa-\\ntions, and NGOs, as well as interviews with key informants.

They demon-\\nstrate both significant differences and similarities between the countries in\\nhow mental health issues are addressed in the context of competitive\\nemployment.  The legislative, political, social, and economic differences pro-\\nvide the framework for the design and delivery of health care, including\\nmental health services, and the way mental health issues are addressed in\\nthe workplace.  Moreover, the general labour market situation varies in the\\nfive countries, with differing needs and resources to respond to those needs.\\nFor instance, the United States and the United Kingdom currently enjoy low\\nunemployment rates, whereas unemployment has been, and still remains, a\\npersistent problem in continental Europe. Because of the economic recession\\nof the early 1990s, job insecurity has been a pressing issue, particularly, in\\nFinland and Poland.  Union membership also varies greatly among the\\ncounties. \\nSimilarities and differences across the five coun-\\ntries\\nSIZE OF THE PROBLEM\\nI\\nn all five countries the incidence of mental health problems and the costs\\nrelated to them have risen during the past decade.  The increase in the\\nincidence of depression, in particular, is alarming.  However, as the Finnish\\nand German reviews note, the figures do not necessarily reflect an absolute\\nincrease.  Changes in the diagnostic system, more open attitudes, and\\nimproved diagnoses and recognition may contribute to the increase in diag-\\nnosed mental health problems.  However, at any given time, it is estimated\\nthat approximately 20% of the adult population have a mental health prob-\\nlem. \\nLess severe mental health problems which may trigger depression are also\\ncommon.  In Finland over 50% of the workforce experience some kind of\\nstress related symptoms, such as anxiety, depressive feelings, physical pain,\\nsocial exclusion, and sleep disorders.  Poland has recently begun to study the\\ncorrelation between work stress and health status, with a view to develop-\\ning preventive programs, particularly for people in high stress jobs such as\\nfiremen, policemen, and ambulance service workers.  Both the German and\\nFinnish studies identify job insecurity, time pressure, and lack of opportu-\\nnity for career development as potential stress indicators in the workplace.\\nThe issues of stress, burnout, and prevention have also been under scrutiny\\n4'),\n",

In the USA, 40% of workers report their job to be\\nvery or extremely stressful.  In all five reports, the effects of job stress are\\nranked among the most common work-related health problems. \\nWORK-RELATED STRESS\\nT\\nhe Finnish, German, and Polish analyses note the impact of the signifi-\\ncant economic and social changes which took place in the labour mar-\\nkets and society during the 1990s on employees’ wellbeing.  The possible\\nrelationship between unemployment and mental health problems has been\\na common concern.  The German report identifies overemphasis on the out-\\ncomes, blurring boundaries between work and the private domain, overload,\\nunpredictability of work requirements, and neglect of safety and health pro-\\ntection at work as the main negative side effects of recent changes in the\\nlabour market.  The analyses recognise, however, that there were also pos-\\nitive developments during the 1990s, such as decrease in monotony, greater\\nautonomy at work, and increased group work and co-operation.  In the case\\nof Poland, the transformation of the socio-economic system has fostered pos-\\nitive values such as pluralism, democracy, and freedom, but it also intro-\\nduced new problems such as unemployment, growing rates of poverty and\\ncrime, and a decreasing sense of security.  In the UK and the USA, the\\nlabour markets have been more stable with respect to unemployment,\\nalthough they have been affected by the globalisation process. \\nCOSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS\\nA\\ns already mentioned, the costs associated with mental health difficulties\\nare a common concern in all five countries.  Governments, employers,\\nemployees, insurance companies, and society as a whole bear their share of\\ndirect (sick pay, benefits, social security, medical treatments) and indirect\\ncosts (loss of productivity and potential output and low morale related to\\nmental health problems).  It is easier to quantify costs related to mental\\nhealth in the USA than in the European economies.  In Europe a greater\\nburden is still met by welfare and health services and other government\\nagencies, whereas in the USA employers are directly responsible for\\nemployee costs.  However, since the methods of evaluation, concepts, and\\nindicators for mental health vary from country to country, it is very difficult\\nto provide any comparable and reliable data concerning either the occur-\\nrence of mental health disorders or the costs related to them.\\nIn the member states of the European Union the cost of mental health prob-\\nlems is estimated to be on average 3 to 4 % of GNP.  In the USA, the esti-\\nmates for national spending on depression range from $30 to $44 billion,\\nwith approximately 200 million days lost from work each year.  A UK gov-\\nernmental agency, the Health and Safety Executive, estimates that mental\\nhealth problems are the second largest category of occupational ill health\\nafter muscular-skeletal disorders, resulting in five to six million working\\ndays lost annually.  In Finland and in Germany, growing social security\\ncosts are of great concern.  In both countries early retirement due to mental\\nhealth difficulties, in particular depression, has been increasing, and men-\\ntal health difficulties are the most common cause of disability pensions.  The\\nPolish situation analysis points out the high costs associated with mental\\nhealth difficulties but, due to lack of data, it is not able to provide exact fig-\\nures. \\nLEGISLATION\\nI\\nt should be emphasised that legislation and the implementation of poli-\\ncies or laws are at the root of national differences in dealing with mental\\nhealth issues.

Poland is developing its approach and seems to be following the\\nEU countries.  In the UK and the US, the introduction of employment dis-\\nability anti-discrimination legislation, such as the Americans with\\nDisabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the British Disability Discrimination Act\\n(DDA) of 1995, has obliged employers to mainstream people with disabilities\\ninto the labour force.  Both laws make it unlawful for an employer to dis-\\ncriminate against people with mental health problems and set requirements\\nwith respect to employment of people with disabilities.  \\nIn Finland, Germany, and Poland, where this strong legal impetus is miss-\\ning, the approach to mental health issues in the workplace stems more from\\nthe perspective of stress prevention and healthy work organisation.  Finland\\ndoes not have over-arching anti-discrimination legislation or a quota-sys-\\ntem.  In German legislation, people with disabilities are covered by several\\nActs, including the Severely Disabled Persons Act, which sets a 6% quota for\\nthe employment of people with disabilities by public and private companies\\nwith minimum workforces of 16 people.  German and Finnish legislation\\nputs physically, mentally, and psychologically disabled persons on an equal\\nbasis.  However, in both countries this leads to unequal treatment, because\\nmost of the rehabilitation measures are geared to the needs of people with\\nphysical disabilities. \\nPolish legislation, passed in 1994, specifically addresses mental health con-\\ncerns.  According to the Mental Health Act, mental health is a fundamental\\nhuman value and the protection of rights of people with mental disorders is\\nan obligation of the State.  The Act proclaims, among other things, “...men-\\ntal health protection shall consist in the promotion of mental health and the\\nprevention of mental disorders.”  The Polish situation analysis, however,\\npoints out that some of the provisions of the Mental Health Act, particular-\\nly as it concerns employment and rehabilitation, have not been implement-\\ned.  This is partly because the socio-economic changes in Poland have affect-\\ned general employment opportunities and the resources necessary to pro-\\nmote and implement new legislation.  In Finland, Germany, and Poland,\\nmental health problems are often seen as disabling only when they are so\\nsevere that they prevent a person from obtaining or maintaining employ-\\nment.  In the UK, and in particular in the USA, less severe mental health\\nproblems are more likely to be seen as a disability if they interfere with daily\\nliving and work.  This reflects the emphasis of each country’s legislative\\nframework.  \\nACCESS TO SERVICES\\nT\\nhe reports state that access to mental health services is often limited\\nand not comprehensive.  There is a lack of parity in resources provided\\nfor mental health versus physical health.  This is particularly evident in\\nrehabilitation services, which traditionally have been more prevalent for\\nphysical disabilities.  Several reports also note that often general practi-\\ntioners, not specialised services, deal with people with mental health prob-\\nlems.  For instance, in the UK, 80 % of the people diagnosed with depression\\nare treated entirely within the primary health care services, and it has been\\nestimated that approximately 40 % of all the visits to primary health care\\nare due to the most common mental health difficulties.  The countries are\\nalso concerned about low detection rates, which indicate that mental health\\nproblems are often underreported and underestimated.  Stigma associated\\nwith mental health issues and use of mental health care services still exists\\nin all five countries.  Stigma may prevent the person suffering from a men-\\ntal health problem from seeking treatment, and ultimately, can lead to\\nunnecessarily severe and costly problems.\\n6'),\n",

Mental health issues have not traditionally belonged to the\\ndomain of occupational health care services, but their importance to employ-\\nees’ work ability has been recognised, and more attention and resources\\nhave been devoted to them.  In the USA and the UK, where the occupation-\\nal health care services operate on a different basis, Employee Assistance\\nProgrammes (EAP) are becoming a more common and popular means to\\nprovide counselling and confidential information.

All\\nthe situation analyses identify various national agencies and bodies that\\ncontribute to the issues related to mental health in the workplace.  For\\ninstance, in the USA, the National Institute on Disability and\\nRehabilitation Research and the Center for Mental Health Services have\\nbeen promoting the ADA and providing technical advice resulting in imple-\\nmentation.  A recent UK government White Paper recognises mental health\\ndifficulties as a major cause of ill health, disability, and early mortality in\\nthe UK and gives priority to development of extensive mental health care\\nservices.  A Finnish governmental agency, the National Research and\\nDevelopment Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES), has been an active\\nadvocate for mental health issues in the European Union.  In Germany, the\\ngovernment is committed to equal opportunities.  However, as the German\\nreview notes, legal regulations, institutions, and services cannot always do\\nmore than provide the framework for integration.  \\nThe reviews acknowledge the importance of collaboration between workers’\\nand employers’ organizations in addressing mental health issues.  The\\nFinnish and German reports illustrate employers’ and workers’ interest in\\ntackling issues such as mobbing, time pressure, stress, and impact of tech-\\nnology as they relate to employee’s work ability.  In the UK both the employ-\\ners and workers are campaigning against work-related stress and have par-\\nticipated in discussions concerning the development of DDA.  The USA\\nemployers and workers have shown interest in preventing violence in the\\nworkplace, advocating for mental health benefits, and providing informa-\\ntion concerning accommodations, ADA, recruitment etc.  The Polish report\\ndescribes a lack of interest on the part of both workers and employers in\\nadvancing the employment of people with mental health problems.\\nIn all the five countries non-governmental organisations (NGOs) play a vital\\nrole in raising awareness of mental health issues, disseminating informa-\\ntion, providing services, and reducing stigma surrounding mental health\\nissues.  NGOs have organized successful national campaigns and pro-\\ngrammes to create awareness of mental health issues such as depression\\n(USA, UK), suicide (Finland) and mental health promotion in the workplace\\n(Poland).  It is generally acknowledged that open communication and co-\\noperation between NGOs, government agencies, and employees’ and\\nemployers’ organizations is important in guaranteeing good services for peo-\\nple with mental health problems. \\nEach report identifies academic institutions that are engaged in research on\\nmental health related issues in the workplace.  It is generally recognised,\\nhowever, that the current knowledge base is not complete despite enormous\\nadvances during the last decade in research on the identification, causes,\\nand treatment of mental disorders.

Though it is\\ndifficult to quantify the impact of work on an individual’s mental health (e.g.\\npersonal identity, self esteem, social recognition), the workplace is one of the\\nkey environments that affects our mental well being and health.\\nMinimising work-related mental health risks and stress in the workplace\\ncan significantly reduce the risk of an employee developing mental health\\ndifficulties.  Yet, as the US report states, traditionally, typical worksite\\nhealth promotion programmes have overlooked mental health issues.\\nDuring the last ten years, however, there has been a growing acknowledge-\\nment and awareness of the role of work in promoting or hindering mental\\nwellness and its corollary, mental illness, and many employers are actively\\npromoting mental health in the workplace. However, mental health prob-\\nlems are not the exclusive responsibility of employers and can not be\\naddressed in the workplace alone. \\nIn the United States, employers are increasingly willing to invest in edu-\\ncating their workforces about mental health issues.  Employers have\\nexpressed their concern over the rising health care costs and lost productiv-\\nity due to mental health problems.  Moreover, the increased visibility of the\\ndisability rights’ movement and the impact of the introduction of anti-dis-\\ncriminatory legislation have encouraged employers to take action.  Today,\\napproximately 40 % to 60 % of worksites with more than 50 employees offer\\nsome type of mental health programme, including stress management pro-\\ngrammes.  A continuum of efforts to address mental health problems in the\\nworkplace includes employee education about health promotion and disease\\nprevention; management training; and employee assistance programmes;\\nbenefit design and administration; and information management and inte-\\ngration of corporate health related services. \\nIn Finland, occupational health care is promoting work ability with the sup-\\nport of the government as well as employers’ and workers’ organisations.\\nOften the activities target issues such as the work environment (e.g. enhanc-\\ning occupational safety and ergonomics); management and the organisation\\nof work (e.g. better job design, good communication, clear goals, and inde-\\npendence at work); learning opportunities (e.g. improving occupational\\nskills and team work skills or promoting independent study); and health\\npromotion (e.g. healthy life style, substance abuse prevention, and physical\\nactivities).  These activities do not directly address mental health issues but\\nare essential in terms of reducing stress and creating a “healthy work organ-\\nisation.”\\nIn Germany, mental health difficulties in the workplace are addressed with-\\nin the framework of “corporate health promotion” which encompasses a wide\\nrange of joint measures taken by the employers, employees, and society to\\nimprove health and wellness in the workplace.  The measures aim to\\nimprove work organization and working conditions, promote employees’\\nactive participation, and reinforce their competence.  The social partners\\nactively support corporate health promotion and see it as a way of reducing\\nabsenteeism and costs related to absenteeism.  Corporate health promotion\\nmeasures addressing stress prevention in the workplace target both the\\nindividual (health education, relaxation procedures and training, role-play-\\ning) and work design and organizational issues.  In terms of work design\\nand organizational issues, Germany has developed a specific, systematic\\nprocedure called the “health circle,” which brings together all the relevant\\nstakeholders to identify problems and hazards in the work environment and\\nto develop solutions.

However,\\nmuch has to be\\nachieved to move\\nfrom policy to\\nconcrete prac-\\ntices in promot-\\ning mental health\\nin the workplace.\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Health and Safety Executive recommends that\\na mental health policy should be an integral part of any organisation’s\\nhealth and safety policy.  Some large companies, such as Marks and\\nSpencer, Astra, Zeneca, and The Boots Company, have developed policies\\nwhich have addressed mental health issues in the workplace.  Analysis of\\nthese policies has defined certain key elements of good practice in relation\\nto promoting mental well-being at work in the UK.  The most fundamental\\nstep for organizations is to recognise and accept that mental health is an\\nimportant issue.  Introduction of a mental health policy embodies the organ-\\nisation’s commitment to mental health.  It is important to provide informa-\\ntion on existing stress levels and mental ill health within the organisation,\\nand to elaborate on ways in which organisational structures and functions\\nmay be contributing factors.  The process of analysing the current situation\\nhelps to identify areas and goals for intervention via a mental health policy\\nand to target the specific needs of the organisation.  A mental health policy\\nin the workplace can promote mental well-being, reduce the stigma associ-\\nated with mental ill health, and provide assistance to employees suffering\\nfrom stress or more serious mental health problems.\\nThe Polish situation analysis notes the lack of information concerning work-\\nplace policies and programmes on prevention of mental health problems or\\npromotion of mental health in the workplace.  If such programmes take\\nplace at all, they are sporadic efforts undertaken at the local level.  Some\\nemployers have, however, been more active in establishing stress preven-\\ntion programmes.  The Institute of Polish Occupational Medicine is piloting\\na stress management programme involving the police force, and evaluating\\nthe effectiveness of individual and organisational approaches to stress man-\\nagement.  In general, health promotion is a relatively new concept in Polish\\ncorporate culture and has not generated much interest among Polish com-\\npanies, partly due to the variable and weak financial conditions.  However,\\nthe interest in mental health issues is rising. \\nConclusions\\nI\\nn conclusion there is a growing awareness of the social and economic costs\\nof mental health difficulties and, in particular, of depression in all five\\ncountries examined in this study.  Various governmental agencies, employ-\\nees’ and employers’ organisations and NGOs are taking steps to address the\\ngrowing needs of people experiencing mental health problems.  Company\\npolicies are moving in new directions and employers are showing an inter-\\nest in reducing costs related to absenteeism, improving their productivity,\\nand fulfilling their social responsibility toward their employees.  The\\nincreased concern about stress in the workplace has prompted a more open\\nattitude towards mental health issues and the growth of preventive pro-\\ngrammes in the workplace. \\nHowever, a broad, co-ordinated approach covering prevention, promotion,\\nand rehabilitation still needs to be developed.  Much has to be achieved to\\nmove from policy to concrete practices in promoting mental health in the\\nworkplace.  In particular, the importance of rehabilitation and of specific\\nrehabilitation programmes, which have proven effective, demand increased\\nrecognition. \\nHopefully, these reviews will assist government agencies and employers’\\nand workers’ organisations in developing policy and enterprise-specific pro-\\ngrammes which address the prevention of mental health problems and the\\npromotion of good mental health and rehabilitation.  The International\\nLabour Organisation, for its part, will continue to develop guidelines for\\nmental health promotion in the workplace. \\n9'),\n",

Terms are often used interchangeably, which can be confusing as well as inac-\\ncurate.  It is therefore useful to attempt to define the vocabulary of mental health and to\\nmake distinctions.  Specific countries use different terminology to refer to the same issue.\\nIn the five situation analyses of mental health in the workplace, the reports have remained\\nfaithful to the terminology used by the mental health community in each country.  This\\nglossary therefore includes definitions of these nation- specific terms.  The following defi-\\nnitions and terminology are based on current usage by such organizations as the WHO and\\nILO, participating countries in the situational analyses, and the European Union.  \\nThis glossary is conceptually oriented and will give the reader the familiarity with the\\nvocabulary of mental health, which is necessary to fully understand the situation analyses.\\nMENTAL HEALTH: Though many elements of mental health may be identifiable, the term is\\nnot easy to define.  The meaning of being mentally healthy is subject to many interpreta-\\ntions rooted in value judgements, which may vary across cultures.  Mental health should\\nnot be seen as the absence of illness, but more to do with a form of subjective well-being,\\nwhen individuals feel that they are coping, fairly in control of their lives, able to face chal-\\nlenges, and take on responsibility.  Mental health is a state of successful performance of\\nmental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other peo-\\nple, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with adversity specific to the individual’s\\nculture.1\\nMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS: The vast majority of mental health problems are relatively\\nmild, though distressing to the person at the time, and if recognized can be alleviated by\\nsupport and perhaps some professional help.  Work and home life need not be too adverse-\\nly affected if the appropriate help is obtained.2 In the situation analyses, the terms mental\\nhealth problems and mental health difficulties are used interchangeably.\\nMENTAL ILLNESS: Mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable mental health prob-\\nlems which become “clinical,” that is where a degree of professional intervention and treat-\\nment is required.  Generally, the term refers to more serious problems, rather than, for\\nexample, a mild episode of depression or anxiety requiring temporary help.\\nThe major psychotic illnesses, such as endogenous depression, schizophrenia, and manic\\ndepressive psychosis, would fall in this category and would be seen less often in the work-\\nplace.3 Mental illness is sometimes referred to as psychiatric disability.4 This term is used\\nprimarily in the United States.\\nMENTAL DISORDERS: Mental disorders are health conditions characterized by alterations\\nin thinking, mood or behaviour ( or some combination thereof) associated with distress and\\n/or impaired functioning.  Mental disorders are associated with increased mortality rates.\\nThe risk of death among individuals with a mental disorder is several times higher than in\\nthe population as a whole.5\\nDEPRESSION:  Depression is an example of a mental disorder largely marked by alterations\\nin mood as well as loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed.  It affects more women\\nthan men, by a ratio of about 2 to 1.  It is projected that up to 340 million people will suf-\\nfer from depression in the near future.  The risk of suicide is high amongst those suffering\\nfrom depression.  Yearly, over 800,000 deaths attributable to suicide are recorded world-\\nwide:The majority of suicides are due to depression.6\\n10'),\n",

However, it is important to realize that depression is not simple.  There are\\ndifferent types and different degrees of each type.  There is a high degree of variation\\namong people with depression in terms of symptoms, course of illness, and response to\\ntreatment, all indicating the complexity and interacting causes of this illness.  The most\\ncommon form of depression is chronic unipolar depression (clinical depression).  This cat-\\negory of depression has been frequently discussed and written about in the popular media\\nin recent years, primarily due to new modalities of treatment.\\nOther types of depression recognized at this time are:\\n•\\nAcute Situational Depression\\n•\\nDysthymia\\n•\\nBipolar Depression (manic depressive disorder)\\n•\\nSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\\n•\\nPost Partum Depression\\n•\\nDepression secondary to other diseases or drugs.\\nMENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION:  Mental health promotion is a multidimensional concept\\nthat implies the creation of individual, social, and environmental conditions, which enable\\noptimal overall psychological development.  It is especially focussed, among other con-\\ncerns, on personal autonomy, adaptability, and ability to cope with stressors, self-confi-\\ndence, social skills, social responsibility, and tolerance.  Prevention of mental disorders\\ncould be one of its outcomes.7\\nMENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION: Prevention is based on specific knowledge about causal\\nrelationships between an illness and risk factors.  Prevention results in measurable out-\\ncomes.  Within the context of the workplace, prevention is concerned with taking action to\\nreduce or eliminate stressors.  Prevention and promotion are overlapping and related\\nactivities.  Promotion can be simultaneously preventative and vice versa.8\\nPOST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER:  PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder can occur\\nas an acute disorder soon after a trauma or have a delayed onset in which symptoms occur\\nmore than 6 months after the trauma.  It can occur at any age and can follow a natural\\ndisaster such as flood or fire or a man-made disaster such as war, imprisonment, assault,\\nor rape.\\nREHABILITATION: A process aimed at enabling persons with disabilities to regain and\\nmaintain their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric, and/ or social function-\\nal levels, by providing them with tools to change their lives towards a higher level of inde-\\npendence.  Rehabilitation may include measures to provide and/ or restore functions or\\ncompensate for the loss or absence of a function or for a functional limitation.  The reha-\\nbilitation process does not involve initial medical care.  It includes a wide range of meas-\\nures and activities from more basic and general rehabilitation to goal-oriented activities,\\nfor instance vocational rehabilitation.9\\nSTRESS: Stress is defined as a nonspecific response of the body to any demand made upon\\nit which results in symptoms such as rise in the blood pressure, release of hormones,\\nquickness of breathe, tightening of muscles, perspiration, and increased cardiac activity.\\nStress is not necessarily negative.  Some stress keeps us motivated and alert, while to lit-\\ntle stress can create problems.  However, too much stress can trigger problems with men-\\ntal and physical health, particularly over a prolonged period of time.10\\nJOB STRESS: Job stress can be defined as the harmful physical and emotional response\\nthat occurs when the requirements of the job do not match the capabilities, resources, or\\nneeds of the worker.  Job stress can lead to poor health and even injury.  Long - term expo-\\nsure to job stress has been linked to an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders,\\ndepression, and job burnout, and may contribute to a range of debilitating diseases, rang-\\ning from cardiovascular disease to cancer.  Stressful working conditions also may interfere\\nwith an employee’s ability to work safely, contributing to work injuries and illnesses.  In\\n11'),\n",

The prevalence of burnout and stress, which\\nwas studied for the first time in 1997 in conjunction with macro-level devel-\\nopments in the world of work, is alarmingly high in the Finnish labour\\nforce.  Some 50 % of Finns report some symptoms, and 7 % suffer from\\nsevere burnout.  There are many reasons for the increase in the incidence\\nof mental health disorders, including changes in the diagnostic system,\\nimproved recognition, the economic recession of the early 1990s, and high\\nunemployment.  Awareness of the scope of the problems and their impact\\non productivity has also risen, and the occupational health care providers\\nand employers are demonstrating their willingness to address the issue in\\nthe workplace.  Mental health is part of the concept of work ability that has\\nbeen a concern to governments, employees and employers, particularly dur-\\ning the past decade. \\nThis situation analysis provides an overview of mental health issues in the\\nworld of work in Finland. Three topics are examined in depth.  They are:\\nMental health at the national level; The role of government and social part-\\nners; and Managing mental health issues in the workplace. \\nMental health at the national level\\nM\\nental health at the national level begins with an overview of the\\nprevalence of mental disorders, stress, and burnout in Finland, with\\nan emphasis on work-related problems.  The recession of the 1990s brought\\nmany changes to Finnish society and the Finnish labour market, such as\\nhigh unemployment, job insecurity, short-term contracts, and time pres-\\nsure.  Several studies have connected the high prevalence of stress,\\nburnout, and depression to changes taking place in the labour market.\\nHowever, so far epidemiological studies are limited \\nThe situation analysis notes the increased economic burden related to men-\\ntal health problems.  In 1994, the total cost of mental health disorders to\\nsociety in Finland was calculated as 2 % of GNP, with depression account-\\ning for about half that cost.  Mental health disorders are the leading cause\\nof disability pensions.  In the realm of work, mental health problems may\\nreduce a person’s work ability and result in lowered productivity and\\nincreased levels of absenteeism.  They are therefore responsible for eco-\\nnomic losses to both employees and employers.  However, their total\\nhuman and social impact on individuals and their families cannot be quan-\\ntified.\\nThe report examines individuals’ access to mental health care services in\\ndetail.  Both the municipal health care system, which covers all residents\\nof Finland, and the occupational health care system provide extensive serv-\\nices and cover mental health care.  However, the economic downturn of the\\nearly 1990s, which brought pressure to cut costs, resulted in fundamental\\nchanges in the Finnish health care system, particularly in the realm of\\nmental health care.  The number of inpatient beds was reduced dramati-\\ncally.

The law does, however, guarantee access to the required spe-\\ncialised services.

This is\\ndue mainly to rationalisation and the rapid introduction of technology,\\nwhich took place in the industrial and service sectors.  New activities and\\nworkplaces, a greater emphasis on group work, “just-in-time” and “lean\\nproduction,” and a change in the division of labour due to outsourcing are\\nhaving a significant effect on job-related stress.  On the positive side, these\\nchanges have reduced monotony, increased cooperation, and led to greater\\nautonomy and decision-making ability through group work and more high-\\nly skilled tasks.  Nonetheless, stress due to time pressure and deadlines\\nand demands in terms of quality, quantity, and greater flexibility is\\nincreasing.  Many companies, however, recognise that they will only make\\nappreciable gains in productivity by creating a motivated and committed\\nworkforce.  The future level of work stress will therefore vary according to\\nthe economic sector, the economic situation, the level of rationalisation, the\\ncorporate philosophy of the company, and the objectives of trade union rep-\\nresentatives. \\nThe lack of information makes it difficult to perform a statistical analysis\\nin Germany regarding all types of disabilities, including disabilities due to\\nmental health disorders.

This has had serious ramifications for the labour market and for the\\nmental wellbeing of people in the workplace.  On the positive side, plural-\\nism, democracy, and freedom entered all spheres of public life including\\nlabour.  On the negative side, poverty, unemployment, and crime increased\\nin Poland, and the sense of security in everyday life decreased, impacting\\nmental health.  During the same years, reforms in the mental health care\\nsystem, which were long overdue, started coming to fruition. After two\\ndecades of effort, the country developed its first Mental Health Programme\\nin 1992, and finally passed the Mental Health Act in 1994.  These were\\nmajor steps in creating a framework for meeting the needs of people suf-\\nfering from mental health disorders, preventing mental illness, and pro-\\nmoting mental health.  \\nLegislation and policy\\nT\\nhe Mental Health Act, which was amended in 1997 and 1999, estab-\\nlishes legal protection of human rights for people with mental health\\ndisorders.  Under the Act, the State, local authorities and a variety of other\\ninstitutions are responsible for the care and protection of persons with\\nmental health disorders; the promotion of mental health; and the develop-\\nment of a legal and social environment in which persons with mental\\nhealth disorders can live in the family and the community.\\nThe goal of the Mental Health Programme is to shift the care of people with\\nmental health disorders from large, geographically isolated institutions to\\ncommunity-based facilities and programs.  As amended in 1999, the pro-\\ngramme assumes the co-operation of labour and social agencies, education-\\nal institutions, and NGOs in furthering this end.  The revised programme\\nemphasises implementing prevention and promotion programmes; prepar-\\ning the mental health care system to cope with Poland’s new socio-econom-\\nic conditions; and developing more workplaces and job opportunities for\\npeople with mental health disorders.\\nPrevalence of mental health disorders\\nI\\nn terms of diagnosing mental health disorders, the ICD-10 international\\nclassification was introduced in Poland in 1997.  Since then the epidemi-\\nological data has been comparable with data from other countries.  The\\nInstitute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw collects and publishes\\nyearly statistics on mental health.  The data indicates that growing num-\\nbers of people, especially patients suffering from depressive disorders, are\\nreceiving mental health care in outpatient and inpatient facilities.  This\\ntrend can be related to Poland’s socio-economic transformation and the con-\\ncomitant rise in unemployment and crime, the decreasing sense of security\\nin the workplace, and anxiety over the decline in living standards.\\n18'),\n",

Recently, a number of\\nsurveys have taken place.  They focused on:\\n•\\nthe relationship between somatic and depressive symptoms and stress-\\nful working conditions;\\n•\\nthe occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder as a psychological con-\\nsequence of traumatic events in the workplace;\\n•\\nthe rise in absenteeism due to mental health disorders during the peri-\\nod of socio-economic transformation;\\n•\\nthe impact of unemployment on mental health status, e.g. the fear of job\\nloss, the correlation between unemployment and depressive symptoms,\\nand the consumption of psychoactive substances;\\n•\\nthe increase in suicide rates during the years of economic transforma-\\ntion.\\nExisting guidelines on stress management and educational initiatives in the\\narea of mental health are often based on experience in other countries,\\nwhich is not relevant to Poland’s transition situation.  Though occupational\\nmedicine practitioners are responsible for prevention of mental health dis-\\norders, these are not governed by any detailed legal mandates, and so appro-\\npriate interventions are not taking place.  There is no information on work-\\nplace policies or programmes of primary prevention in Poland.  In 1997 the\\nNational Centre of Workplace Health Promotion was established in the\\nInstitute of Occupational Medicine in Lódz, but mental health promotion is\\nnot one of its specific targets.\\nMental health and employment\\nT\\nhere are very few jobs for people with mental health disorders.

There are no\\ngovernmental or non-governmental facilities to provide people with mental\\nhealth disorders with the training and skills they need to gain access to the\\nopen labour market. Neither employers’ organisations nor trade unions\\nhave made the employment and retention of people with mental health dis-\\norders a priority.  There is reason to hope that non-governmental organisa-\\ntions, such as the Coalition for Mental Health, will play an increasingly\\nimportant role in changing the way people with mental heath disorders are\\ncared for and in improving their lives and working conditions\\nConclusion\\nI\\nn conclusion, over the past decade, Poland has acquired a legislative\\nframework in which to begin meeting the needs of people with mental\\nhealth disorders in the workplace.  However, much remains to be done to\\ntranslate principles into practice.  Until recently, working conditions for\\npeople with mental health disorders and the relationship between working\\nconditions and mental health have not been a high priority for the govern-\\nment, employers, or Polish society as a whole.  However, awareness of the\\nproblems of people with mental health disorders in the workplace and the\\nwill to address them are growing.  The time is therefore right for new ini-\\ntiatives to improve the situation.  They include:\\n•\\nresearch on the consequences of Poland’s socio-economic transformation\\nand working conditions on mental health;\\n•\\nlegislative initiatives which mandate working conditions to protect men-\\ntal health and workplace accommodations for persons with mental\\nhealth disorders;\\n•\\ndevelopment of mental health promotion programmes.\\n19'),\n",

This situation analysis provides an overview of mental health issues\\nwith respect to the world of work in the UK.  Its main focus is on the pop-\\nulation currently in mainstream employment but facing mental health dif-\\nficulties.\\nHowever, it is important to recognise that only 12 % of people\\nwith diagnosed mental health problems are actively participating in the\\nopen labour market in the UK. \\nThe analysis looks at three areas in depth: Mental health at the national\\nlevel examines the scope of mental health problems in the workplace and\\nrelevant legislation and policies. The role of government and social part-\\nners elaborates on the roles of employers’ and workers’ organisations,\\nNGOs, and academic institutions.  Managing mental health issues in the\\nworkplace provides examples of steps undertaken in the British workplace\\nto address employees’ mental health. \\nMental health at the national level \\nM\\nental health at the national level begins by examining the prevalence\\nof mental health problems in the United Kingdom.  The great major-\\nity of those affected by mental health problems are in the working-age pop-\\nulation, between ages 16 and 64.  Each year, nearly 3 out of every 10\\nemployees experience mental health problems.  Numerous studies on stress\\nconfirm that work-related stress and the illness it causes are common.  The\\nself-reported occurrence of anxiety and depression ranges from 15 % to 30%\\nof the working population.  Depression, in particular, is a common problem:\\nAt any given time one in every 20 working-aged Britons is experiencing\\nmajor depression.\\nThe situation analysis recognises the impact of mental health problems on\\nemployees, employers, and society at large.  Fourteen per cent of UK\\nNational Health Service (NHS) inpatient costs and 23 % NHS pharmaceu-\\ntical costs are due to mental illness.  Mental illness accounts for 14 % of cer-\\ntified sickness absences in the UK, translating into an annual loss of\\napproximately 80 million working days.  In a survey on most common work-\\nrelated illnesses, employees ranked stress, depression, and anxiety as the\\nsecond most common work-related illnesses after musculoskeletal illness-\\nes.  Each year, mental illness accounts for £3.7 million in direct costs in\\nterms of working days lost.  The Confederation of British Industry has\\nestimated the costs of certified sickness absence and other direct produc-\\ntivity losses due to stress and mental health at £5.3 billion annually.  \\nThe situation analysis also provides an overview of individuals’ access to\\nhealth care services and information on mental health problems.  In the\\nUK, 80 % of people diagnosed with depression are treated entirely within\\nprimary health care.  It has been estimated that approximately 40 % of all\\nprimary health care visits are due to common mental health disorders.\\nOccupational health care has not traditionally played a significant role in\\nthe British health care system.  Over 75 % of firms in the UK do not pro-\\nvide occupational health care services other than the statutory require-\\nment of first aid.  In terms of access to information, various agencies have\\n20\\nPopulation:\\n59.1 million\\nGDP per capita:\\n$21,200 (est. 1998)\\nUnemployment:\\n7.5% (est. 1998)\\nIn the UK, mental\\nillness accounts\\nfor 14 % of certi-\\nfied sickness\\nabsences, and\\nemployees  rank\\nstress, depres-\\nsion, and anxiety\\nas the second\\nmost common\\nwork-related ill-\\nnesses after mus-\\nculoskeletal ill-\\nnesses.'),\n",

The Mental Health Act (1983) is currently under\\nreview. \\nThe role of government and the social partners\\nD\\nuring the 1990s, the British Government actively addressed mental\\nhealth issues.  In the early 1990s the Department of Health brought\\ntogether an interagency group, including representatives from employees’\\nand employers’ organisations, to address mental health issues in the work-\\nplace.  These activities resulted in conferences, publications, and leaflets.\\nMore recently, a 1999 White Paper, “Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation,”\\ntargeted mental health problems as one of the five major health problems to\\nbe tackled in the UK.  The White Paper recognises mental health problems\\nas a major cause of ill health, disability, and early mortality in the UK.\\nThese findings have been taken seriously, and mental health is one of the\\nfirst new National Service Frameworks to be implemented since April 2000.\\nIn addition, in 1999, the Ministries for Public Health and for Safety and\\nHealth launched a “Healthy Workplace Initiative”, and the Health and\\nSafety executive has published guidelines on mental health, stress, and\\nwork.\\nIn the UK, employees’ and employers’ organisations play an active role in\\nmental health issues.  This situation analysis notes that the Trade Union\\nCongress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) have been\\nactively involved in interagency activities on mental health and work and\\nhave also dealt with the issue of stress among their members. The CBI has\\npublished a “Managers’ Toolkit on Management of Mental Well Being” for\\ndistribution to its members.  The Employers Forum on Disability has pub-\\nlished several leaflets providing information on practical issues related to\\nmental health difficulties and other disabilities (e.g., accommodations and\\nstress prevention) and policy and the legislative framework in the UK. \\nThe situation analysis also introduces non-governmental organisations\\nworking on mental health and employment-related issues, such as MIND\\nand Mental Health Media.  They have both recently published guidelines\\nand information packages concerning mental health issues and work.\\nNGOs play an important role in advocating employment of people with dis-\\nabilities and providing information on the implementation of the Disability\\nDiscrimination Act in the UK. \\nSeveral British academic institutes are conducting research on mental\\nhealth problems and the world of work.

Yearly, approximately one in ten adults experiences a\\ndepressive disorder in the U.S.  Depression is a workplace health issue that\\nsignificantly impacts the bottom line.  In this situational analysis, the lit-\\nerature showed that depression-related illnesses predominated in preva-\\nlence and cost over other traditional occupational health issues, such as\\nsubstance disorders.  It is estimated that depression costs the nation\\nbetween $30 and $44 billion with approximately 200 million lost workdays\\neach year.  Employers assume much of this financial burden associated\\nwith depression, both in direct treatment costs and through absenteeism,\\nreduced productivity, and more frequent work-related accidents.  However,\\nit is important to note that the treatment success rate for depression is\\nhigh, ranging from 65% to 80%.  Although this report focuses on examining\\nthe impact of depression, it is often assessed within the context of overall\\nmental health or psychiatric problems.  This is due, in large part, to the\\nnature of the data which does not always distinguish between depression\\nand overall mental health problems, particularly in terms of policy and leg-\\nislative framework.\\nThe situational analysis examines three major areas: Mental health at the\\nnational level, The role of government and social partners, and Managing\\nmental health in the workplace.\\nMental health at the national level begins with a discussion\\nof the evolution of the disability rights movement in the U.S.  Historically,\\nthe disability rights movement has consisted primarily of people with phys-\\nical disabilities.  Because the disability rights movement has a significant\\nimpact on current public policy and social awareness, mental health advo-\\ncacy and awareness must be viewed within its overall context.  One of the\\nkey themes in this situational analysis is that while stigma and discrimi-\\nnation affect the lives of all people with disabilities, people with mental\\nhealth problems suffer from some of their harshest manifestations.\\nThe report notes that during the 1990s there was a substantial increase in\\nawareness, attention, and targeted action regarding mental illness and\\ndepression, in particular.  This is due in large part to specific organisations\\nand campaigns.  Although goals and activities may differ and vary, they all\\npromote the importance of employment or some meaningful activity for\\npeople with mental health problems.  There are a number of negative\\nmyths regarding the impact of mental illness on the workplace, for exam-\\nple that mentally ill and mentally restored employees tend to be second\\nrate workers.  In fact, employers who have hired these individuals report\\nthat they are higher than average in attendance and punctuality and as\\ngood or better than other employees in motivation, quality of work, and job\\ntenure.  It is hoped that, with increased awareness of the causes and treat-\\nment of mental health problems, these myths will abet over time.\\nWork is at the very core of contemporary life for most people, providing\\nfinancial security, personal identity, and an opportunity to make a mean-\\ningful contribution to community life.

The Americans with Disabilities Act represents a watershed in\\nthe history of the disability rights movement in the U.S.  It is one of the most\\nsignificant employment laws in U.S. history.

Although most union advocacy has been associated\\nwith physical disabilities, there has been a growing recognition of mental\\nhealth issues, particularly the impact of workplace violence on the mental\\nhealth of employees.  \\nAlthough there are numerous employers’ organisations, two stand out in\\nterms of their work on employment and mental health issues as well as\\ntheir partnerships with government agencies.  They are the Washington\\nBusiness Group on Health and the National Business and Disability\\nCouncil.\\nNon-governmental organisations are vital in raising awareness of mental\\nhealth issues and advocating for people with psychiatric disabilities.  The\\nsituational analysis points out that there are perhaps thousands of con-\\nsumer and professional groups representing the interests of individuals\\nwith psychiatric disabilities.  The report highlights several national organ-\\nisations which have been vital in raising awareness of mental health issues,\\neliminating stigma and discrimination, and advocating for appropriate leg-\\nislation and the availability of jobs.\\nThe US has numerous academic institutions that conduct research, organ-\\nise conferences, and disseminate information on mental health, as well as\\nprovide mental health services.  These institutions often work closely with\\na government agency or agencies, perhaps funding a particular research\\nstudy or conference.\\nManaging mental heath in the workplace examines work-\\nfamily issues and their impact on productivity; employee education for men-\\ntal health promotion, and mental illness prevention and provides illustra-\\ntions of corporate experiences and innovations. \\nAn overriding theme throughout this situational analysis is that employers\\nof all sizes are beginning to recognise that depressive disorders often con-\\nstitute their single highest mental health (medical) and disability cost.  A\\nlarge percentage of employers understand the relationship between health\\nand productivity and are improving their management strategies by devel-\\noping and implementing programs supportive of work/family/life issues,\\nsuch as flextime, part-time schedules, child care benefits, personal leave,\\nwellness-health programs, and family counselling.  Innovative employers\\nhave developed practices in conjunction with their health and human\\nresource systems for managing both the direct and indirect costs and con-\\n25'),\n",
