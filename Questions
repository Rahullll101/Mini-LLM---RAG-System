## Questions for RAG

📘 1️⃣ Transformer Paper — Attention Is All You Need

What is the main idea behind the Transformer model?
→ A neural network architecture based entirely on self-attention without using recurrence or convolution.

Why does the Transformer remove recurrence and convolutions?
→ To allow parallel computation and better modeling of long-range dependencies.

What are the two main components of the Transformer architecture?
→ Encoder and Decoder stacks.

What is self-attention in the Transformer?
→ A mechanism that allows each word to attend to all other words in the sequence when forming representations.

What is multi-head attention and why is it used?
→ Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel to capture different types of relationships.

How does the Transformer handle positional information?
→ Using positional encodings added to input embeddings.

What tasks were used to evaluate the Transformer?
→ Machine translation tasks (e.g., English–German, English–French).

What performance metric was used in translation experiments?
→ BLEU score.

How many layers are used in the encoder and decoder stacks?
→ 6 layers each.

What advantages does the Transformer have over RNNs?
→ Faster training, better parallelization, improved long-distance dependency handling.

📘 2️⃣ Object Detection with Deep Learning

What is object detection in computer vision?
→ Identifying and locating objects in an image using bounding boxes and labels.

What are the three stages of traditional object detection?
→ Region proposal, feature extraction, and classification.

Why did deep learning improve object detection performance?
→ CNNs automatically learn powerful hierarchical features.

What is R-CNN?
→ A model that uses region proposals + CNN feature extraction + SVM classification.

What improvement does Fast R-CNN bring over R-CNN?
→ Shares convolution computations → faster training and testing.

What is Faster R-CNN’s main contribution?
→ Introduced the Region Proposal Network (RPN).

How is YOLO different from R-CNN methods?
→ YOLO performs detection in a single pass (real-time).

What are region proposal methods?
→ Techniques to suggest candidate object regions before classification.

What are regression-based detection methods?
→ Methods that directly predict bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.

What applications of object detection are mentioned?
→ Face detection, pedestrian detection, autonomous driving, surveillance.

📘 3️⃣ Air Pollution Health Advisory (Govt.)

What is the purpose of this health advisory document?
→ To guide the health sector and public on managing air pollution risks.

What health problems are linked to air pollution?
→ Respiratory diseases, heart disease, asthma, lung infections.

Who are considered vulnerable populations?
→ Children, elderly, pregnant women, and people with existing illnesses.

What is AQI and why is it important?
→ Air Quality Index; indicates pollution level and health risk.

What role does the health sector play?
→ Awareness, preparedness, surveillance, treatment.

What preventive measures are suggested for the public?
→ Staying indoors, masks, avoiding outdoor activity during high pollution.

How can states obtain air quality information?
→ From CPCB/state monitoring systems.

What guidance is given for school children?
→ Limit outdoor activity during high pollution days.

What are the recommendations for healthcare preparedness?
→ Training staff, ensuring medicine availability, monitoring cases.

What does the advisory suggest during high pollution days?
→ Reduce exposure and increase protective measures.

📘 4️⃣ Machine Learning Basics

What is machine learning?
→ A field where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions.

What are the four main types of machine learning?
→ Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement learning.

What is supervised learning?
→ Learning using labeled data.

What is unsupervised learning?
→ Finding patterns in unlabeled data.

What is reinforcement learning?
→ Learning by trial and error with rewards.

What is the difference between training and testing data?
→ Training data builds the model; testing data evaluates it.

What is overfitting?
→ Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

What is underfitting?
→ Model is too simple to capture patterns.

What is classification in ML?
→ Predicting a category/label.

Why is validation data used?
→ To tune the model and avoid overfitting.

📘 5️⃣ Mental Health in the Workplace (ILO)

Why is mental health in the workplace important?
→ It affects productivity, well-being, and economic costs.

How do mental health problems affect productivity?
→ Absenteeism, reduced performance.

What are the economic costs of mental health issues?
→ Treatment costs, lost productivity, disability benefits.

What role does stigma play?
→ Prevents employees from seeking help.

How can workplaces help in prevention?
→ Awareness, early identification, supportive policies.

What barriers do affected people face?
→ Stigma, discrimination, lack of support.

How can employers support employees?
→ Flexible policies, accommodations, mental health programs.

What countries were studied?
→ Finland, Germany, Poland, UK, USA.

What is the role of legislation?
→ Protects workers and ensures equal opportunities.

Why is the workplace good for early identification?
→ Regular interaction allows early detection of issues.

📘 6️⃣ NASSCOM HR Policy Manual

What are the normal working hours?
→ 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM (Mon–Fri).

How many earned leave days per year?
→ 21 days.

What is the maternity leave entitlement?
→ 12 weeks.

What is the rule for late coming?
→ Arrival after 9:50 AM is considered late.

Who approves international travel?
→ The President of NASSCOM.

What is the mobile reimbursement rule?
→ Up to 80% of bill, max ₹2000/month (Grades 1–6).

What is paternity leave eligibility?
→ Male employees with 1 year service; 2 weeks leave.

After how many years can a laptop be replaced?
→ After 3.5 years.

What happens if confidentiality is breached?
→ Disciplinary action, possibly termination.

What is the purpose of the induction policy?
→ To familiarize new employees with org structure, policies, and role.
